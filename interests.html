            <ol>
                <h2><i>Full Stack Web Development:</i></h2>
                <ul><li><p>I am very Interested to study full stack web developmet, as it is a very 
                    required talent by most employers. it is also gives me the opportunity to build
                    my own web pages for either personal hobies or private business.

                <h2>React and Spring-Boot:</h2>
                <ul><li><p>Since I really want to be a full stack developer, I have to be good at both
                    front-end and back-end technologies. For this, React, the front end java script 
                    library plays a major role in building the UI, and it is developed by facebook.
                    At the back-end most employers look for a talent in Spring-boot java framework, 
                    which enables us to build Rest APIs to post and fetch data to and from database.
