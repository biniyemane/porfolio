                    <h2>Project 1</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I have build a responsive webpage about my favorite recipe, Ethiopian
                        Doro-Wat, Doro Wat is often associated with special occasions 
                        and celebrations in Ethiopian culture. It is a dish that brings people <br>together, 
                        often enjoyed during communal meals with family and friends. I built this project with 
                        three html pages. The first one is Home page, second one is direction page, wich shows
                        the sep by step description of the amount I use, and the third one is about ingredients
                        I used for preparing Doro-wat. I have also included a contact form page where customers 
                        leave contact information and a message they have.

                    <h2>Project 2</h2>
                    <p>This is an exciting project about github and README.md file in which I worked collaboratively
                        with my colleages in a team. In this project, we could be able to edit readme file using
                        all md file commands, and post our favorite animal image. My favorite image happens to be
                        an Indomitable lion the one shown on the left.

                    <p>This project is a work on progress that I want to make webpage about my favorite sport club
                        Arsenal. It is only one html page and one css file, I have also included some images.
                        I want to make it more dynamic web page once I learn java script. I have included
                        my best players, Saka and odegard, posed on the left.
