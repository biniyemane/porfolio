            <p>Hello! my name is Biniyam, a web developer with a passion for creating interactive and responsive web 
                applications. I love to explore new technologies and apply them in my projects. In this exciting 
                CTAC program I have learned about terminal, internet, GitHub, building webpage using html and css
                . I have done three projects based on what I have learned so far. I born and grew up in Ethiopia, I love 
                 playing soccer, reading books, and going to church for prayer. I watch premier leage games from 
                  britain, and I am arch supporter of Arsenal club</p>
